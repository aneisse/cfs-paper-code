### Data availability

By request of the data provider, the data for this paper could not be shared together with the code. However, some details on the dataset as well as the structure and type of variables can be found on the paper at the *Statistical Methods in Medical Research*.

### How to reproduce the results

The methodology used in the study is robust to random number generation, therefore there is no seed in the code. As a result, the final results might be slightly numerically different from the presented in the paper but there should be no difference in the conclusions.
